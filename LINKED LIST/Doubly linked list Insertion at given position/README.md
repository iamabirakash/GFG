Given a doubly-linked list, a position p, and an integer x. The task is to add a new node with value x at the position just after pth node in the doubly linked list and return the head of the updated list.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 2<->4<->5, p = 2, x = 6 
Output: 2<->4<->5<->6
Explanation: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is inserted after p, i.e, at position 2 (0-based indexing).
Input: LinkedList: 1<->2<->3<->4, p = 0, x = 44
Output: 1<->44<->2<->3<->4
Explanation: p = 0, and x = 44 . So, 44 is inserted after p, i.e, at position 0 (0-based indexing).
Constraints:
0 <= p < size of doubly linked list <= 106
1 <= x <= 106
