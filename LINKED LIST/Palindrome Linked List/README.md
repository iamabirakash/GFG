Given a head singly linked list of positive integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.

Examples:

Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1
Output: true
Explanation: The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 , which is a palindrome and Hence, the output is true.

Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Output: false
Explanation: The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, which is not a palindrome and Hence, the output is false.

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 103
