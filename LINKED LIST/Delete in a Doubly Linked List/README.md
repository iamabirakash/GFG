Given a Doubly Linked list and a position. The task is to delete a node from a given position (position starts from 1) in a doubly linked list and return the head of the doubly Linked list.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4, x = 3
Output: 1 <--> 3
Explanation: After deleting the node at position 3 (position starts from 1),the linked list will be now as 1 <--> 3.
 
Input: LinkedList = 1 <--> 5 <--> 2 <--> 9, x = 1
Output: 5 <--> 2 <--> 9
Explanation:

Constraints:
2 <= size of the linked list <= 106
1 <= x <= size of the linked list 
1 <= node->data <= 104
